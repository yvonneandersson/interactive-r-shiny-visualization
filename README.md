# 📊 Interactive Shiny App & Visualization Tool Review
This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 4**, a group project in which you design an **interactive Shiny app** and present a **data visualization tool** of your choice. The project combines programming in R with tool exploration and presentation.

---

## 🚀 Task 1 – Build an Interactive Shiny App

Create a **Shiny web application** in R using either raw `shiny` code or the `shinyuieditor` tool (used in Lesson 9).

### Requirements:

- You may **choose your own dataset** and **type of visualization** (e.g. chart, map, animation)
- The app must include **interactive inputs (widgets)** that:
  - Filter/select data subsets
  - Adjust visual elements like variables, geometry type, or layers
- Output can be rendered using `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `leaflet`, etc.

📦 You must include:
- An `app.R` file (or split `ui.R`/`server.R`)
- The dataset used to run the app

## 🧪 Task 2 – Data Visualization Tool Exploration & Presentation

Find a data visualization tool you want to explore and present during the seminar. This can be:

- A standalone application (e.g. **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Excel**)
- An online tool (e.g. **RawGraphs**, **Flourish**, etc.)
- An R package or visualization extension

### The presentation (≈ 5 minutes) should include:
- A demo of how the tool works with your dataset
- Your reflections on:
  - 📈 What kinds of visualizations it can produce
  - 💵 Cost/licensing
  - 🧰 Interface: GUI vs. code-based
  - ⚙️ Flexibility, ease of use, export options

You’ll log your selected tool via the course platform using the provided link.

## 📝 Submission Requirements and Results

- ✅ `app.R` – the complete Shiny app
- ✅ `/data/your_dataset.csv` – data used in the app
- ✅ Presentation slides (optional, if digital)

---

## 💬 Summary

This project combines **interactive app development using Shiny** with **exploration of real-world visualization tools**. The dual focus helps students strengthen both technical coding skills and broader understanding of data storytelling platforms.
